*1. The data set cows.txt contains milk production 
	values for 300 (hypothetical) cows, 100 from 
	the Andrews farm, 100 from the Bailey farm, and 
	100 from the Carter farm. 
	
	*a. Import the data into SAS, and find the 
		average milk production, stratified by farm. 
		Also, obtain a histogram and qqplot of the 
		milk production values at each farm;

		data milkdata;
		    infile '/folders/myshortcuts/sas_folder/cows.txt' dlm=',';
		    input milk farm $;
		    IF farm = 'Andrews' THEN Afarm = milk;
		    IF farm = 'Bailey' THEN Bfarm = milk;
		    IF farm = 'Carter' THEN Cfarm = milk;
		proc means data=milkdata mean;
			var Afarm Bfarm Cfarm;
		run;

	*b. Perform and ANOVA to test whether the average 
		milk production at the three farms is the same;

		proc anova data=milkdata;
			class farm;
			model milk=farm;
		run;


	*c. Test whether the average milk production is 
		the same using PROC GLM;

		proc glm data=milkdata;
			class farm;
			model milk=farm;
		run;

*2. Let U(a, b) denote a uniform distribution on the 
	interval [a, b], and N(mu, sigma2) denote a normal 
	distribution with mean mu and variance sigma2. Let 
	X_i1 ~ U(0, 100), X_i2 ~ U(30, 70), and 
	eps_i ~ N(0, 1) for i = 1, ... , 1000. Also, suppose 
	X_i3 is a categorical variable taking the values 'A', 
	'B', and 'C' with probabilities 0.5, 0.35, and 0.15 
	respectively. Finally, assume that all of the random 
	variables X_ij and eps_i are statistically independent 
	and define 
	
	Y_i = 150 + 8 X_i1 + 6 X_i2 + 0.25 X_i2^2 - 7 X_i1 X_i2
			  + 5I(X_i3 = 'B') + 10I(X_i3 = 'C') + eps_i
			  
	Recall that I is the indeicator function. 
	e.g., I(X_i3 = 'B') = 1 if X_i3 = 'B', and 0 otherwise;
	
	*a. Use SAS to simulate values of all random variables 
		described above;

		data simdata;
		call streaminit(123);
		do i = 1 to 1000;
			x1 = rand('UNIFORM');
			x2 = 30 + 70 * rand('UNIFORM');
			u = rand('UNIFORM');
			if u <= 0.5 then do;
				x3 = 'A';
				I_b = 0;
				I_c = 0;
			end;
			else if u <= 0.85 then do;
				x3 = 'B';
				I_b = 1;
				I_c = 0;
			end;
			else do;
				x3 = 'C';
				I_b = 0;
				I_c = 1;
			end;
			eps = rand('NORMAL');
			y = 150. + 8 * x1 + 6 * x2 + 0.25 * x2**2 - 7 * x1 * x2 + 5 * I_b + 10 * I_c + eps;
			output;
		end;
		run;
		
		*proc print data=simdata;
		*run;

	*b. Verify that X_i1, X_i2, and e_i have the 
		distributions given above by plotting histograms 
		for these variables;

		proc univariate data=simdata;
			histogram x1;
			histogram x2;
			histogram eps/normal;
		run;
		
	*c. Verify that the observed frequencies of the different 
		levels of X_i3 are approximately equal to those stated 
		in the problem;

		proc freq data=simdata;
			tables x3;
		run;

	*d. Fit the given regression equation to your simulated 
		data, and verify that the estimated coefficients agree 
		with those stated in the problem; 


		proc glmselect data=simdata;
			class x3;
			model y = x1 x2 x2*x2 x1*x2 x3;
		run;
