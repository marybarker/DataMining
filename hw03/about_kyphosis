##kyphosis {rpart}
#it is a data frame with 81 rows, 4 columns representing data on children 
#who have had corrective spinal surgery.
#
#columns are as follows:
#+ Kyphosis
#+ + + A factor with levels 'absent' 'present' indicating if a kyphosis was 
#+ + + present after the operation
#
#
#+ Age
#+ + + in months
#
#+ Number 
#+ + + the number of vertebrae involved
#
#+ Start
#+ + + The number of the first (topmost) vertebra operated on.
#
#examples:

fit <- rpart(Kyphosis ~ Age + Number + Start, data = kyphosis)
fit2 <- rpart(Kyphosis ~ Age + Number + Start, data = kyphosis, parms = 
              list(prior = c(0.65, 0.35), split = "information"))
fit3 <- rpart(Kyphosis ~ Age + Number + Start, data = kyphosis,  
              control = rpart.control(cp = 0.05))
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), xpd = TRUE)
plot(fit)
text(fit, use.n = TRUE)
plot(fit2)
text(fit2, use.n = TRUE)
